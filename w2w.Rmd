Here's a plot of the 2015 Wharf to Wharf results. The plot shows run time ("elapsed time") vs. age, with an average line by gender and standard deviation in gray. I've done a bit of cleanup on the data, for example: removing results where age is 0; removing an elapsed time outlier at 3 hours 30 minutes. I've put my result and my son's in black.

```{r, echo=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.width=10,fig.height=8}
